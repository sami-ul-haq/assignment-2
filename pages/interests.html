                <p>You will fall in love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting
                    out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food
                    everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with
                    unbelievably delicious bone marrow!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar
                    Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a
                    delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious
                    than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    After tasting the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious
                    Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato,
                    coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique
                    Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was
                    served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND
                    himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It
                    was so amazing to taste!!!
                </p><br>
